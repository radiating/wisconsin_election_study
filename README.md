Study performed on historic Wisconsin state election results for district map gerrymandering and election prediction.

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Carl Klaner, a political scientist at University of Florida. Thanks to Dr. Klaner, detailed historic election data in the state of Wisconsin were collected. My contributions include the cleaning of the original data across years of 2000 - 2016, and in elections of state assembly, state senate, state attorney, state treasurer, state governor, district attorney and US House representative, US Senator. 

In this repository, the preliminary results are presented on state assembly elections, and used to illustrate the core concepts in election prediction and analysis: seat % vs. vote %, wasted votes, efficiency gap, correlation to presidential election. 

Due to proprietary nature of the original data set, only a selection of the processed data are uploaded for the purpose of reproducing plots in the analysis report.
